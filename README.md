# gymAPP #
A website I'm making to let me keep track of my maxes and reps in the gym.

## Frontend ##
- Html
- Css
## Backend ## 
- JS
- Node.js
  - Express JS
- MongoDB

## Current Features ##
- Login with session implementation
- Ability to save:
  - Weights for individual exercises across accounts & update them
  - Date of last gym visit
  - (Technically date of last edit of exercise weight but currently it's not displayed).

## Planned Features ##
- Registration Feature
- Third Party:
  - Hosting for Database
  - Login Auth
  - Maybe even a whole login system overhaul 
- Ability to save values for individual exercises across accounts
- Ability to recover password
- Ability to add new exercises/custom exercises
- Ability to add a custom image for each exercise with a default icon being chosen otherwise
- Better UI/Sleeker design
- Better error handling and cleaner code structure
